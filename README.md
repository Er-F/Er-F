# Introduction 
Hobby programmer, I like analysis and programming. Mostly for fun out side of work. 

## Repositories 
- Project 00: [Comparing Performance Of Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/Er-F/00_Machine-Learning_Model-Comparison) 
- Project 01: [Building A Machine Learning Model From Scratch](https://github.com/Er-F/01_Building-Machine-Learning-Model-From-Scratch)
- Project 02: [Steamlit Dashboard - Database Storage and Visulization](https://github.com/Er-F/01_Project_GenAI)
- Project 03: [Analyzing LinkedIn Job Listings - Topic & Sentiment Calculations](https://github.com/Er-F/02_Project_Analysis)
- Project 04:  [Data Engineering: Building a Simple Data Warehouse using DBT & Medallion Arcitecture](https://github.com/Er-F/04_Project_DBT)


## Comment on coding experience 
  
**Dashboards, Visulizations & Business Intelligence**:
- **Streamlit (Python)**: Built dashboards for interacting with GenAI models 
- **Power BI**: Built several dashboards and datamodels to present buisness analytics 
- **Python Visulizations**: Created sophisticated visulizations using the known libraries Plotly, Seaborn and MatplotLib 

**GenAI & Text Manipulation**: 
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Used LLAMA models to perform sentiment analysis to investigate correlation between positive/negative sentiment on other variables (e.g. on LinkedIN job descriptions)
- **Topic Modeling**: Using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Iâ€™ve (among other things) investigated the main topics of LinkedIn job listings
- **SQL-Agents**: Created an SQL-agent based on OpenAI API that interacted with an SQL database, and solved several difficult problems based on simple prompts from user input 
  
**Machine Learning**: 
- **Model Building**: Built and testing several different types of ML models for real-world applications.
- **Explainability**: Investigated feature importance from trained models to ensure transparent results.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned model parameters to find optimal solution to specific problems.
- **Programmed model from Scratch**: As a master student I built a model from scratch as part of a ML-course. Take a look at the related repository!
  
**Data Processing & Preparation**:
- Experience doing this in several projects 
- Take a look at the cleaning done in the repo: [Project 03](https://github.com/Er-F/02_Project_Analysis)

**Data Engineering**: 
- Experience using DBT, DataBricks (and similar dataplattforms), SAS
