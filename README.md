##  Hi, I'm Erik!üëã
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a passionate Python programmer with experience in Machine Learning and Data Analysis. 

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me And My Main Interest 
I have a strong background in:
- **Python Programming**: I took several courses at university in programming and have continously used Python in my work since then. I very much enjoy the language and all the open source libraries that we all are free to use in our projects! 
- **Machine Learning**: Developing and implementing machine learning models is a very interesting and rewarding task. I have hands-on experience with ML from work (e.g. internship), where I built and tetsed different models (Regression and Classification) for a specific purpose.  
- **Data Processing & Preperation**: Data processing is an exstremely important task for any Data Scientist, and it is important to do this well before using the data in any analytical work. From my experience I have found it to be time-saving to spend slightly more time on this part of the project. A clean and trustworthy dataset is always worth it! 
- **Data Analysis & Visulization**: I believe that a key part of performing good analytical work is presenting results in visulizations that easily provide insights and gives the reader a quick grasp of what type of analytical work that has been done. 

## üìÇ Repositories
Have a look at some of my personal analytical projects! 

- Machine Learning Project: A project where I developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices.
- Project 02: [Analyzing LinkedIn Job Listings - Topic & Sentiment Calculations](https://github.com/Er-F/02_Project_Analysis)
- Data Analysis Project: An analysis of a large dataset to uncover trends and patterns.
