# Hi!üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate problem solver with experience in Machine Learning, Python programming, and Data Analysis. Here, you'll find some of my projects and repositories that highlight what I have experience with and my interests.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me And My Main Interest 
I have a strong background in:
- **Python Programming**: I took several courses at university in programming and have continously used it to solve problems since. 
- **Machine Learning**: Developing and implementing machine learning models is a very interesting and rewarding task for me. I enjoy testing and comparing different model types, and presenting model results/predictions in a understandable way. 
- **Data Processing & Preperation**: Data processing is an exstremely important task for any Data Scientist, and it is important to do this well before using the data in any analytical work. My point of view is that alot of time can be saved, by spending alitle bit more time on this part of the project, than one usually wants. Going to exstra step to get a clean and trustwrothy dataset is always worth it! 
- **Data Analysis & Visulization**: I believe that a key part of performing good analytical work is presenting results in visulizations that easily provide insights and gives the reader a quick grasp of what type of analytical work that has been done. 

## üìÇ Repositories
Here are some of my key repositories:

- Machine Learning Project: A project where I developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices.
- Python Utilities: A collection of useful Python scripts and utilities.
- Data Analysis Project: An analysis of a large dataset to uncover trends and patterns.

## üöÄ Other Projects

In addition to my GitHub repositories, I've worked on several other projects:

- **Project 1**: A web application for real-time data visualization.
- **Project 2**: An automated data pipeline for processing and analyzing large datasets.
- **Project 3**: A machine learning model for sentiment analysis of social media posts.
