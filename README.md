# Hi, I'm Erik – Hobby Programmer & Analytics Enthusiast 📊💻  

Hobby programmer who enjoys investigating analytical techniques, modelling, and visualisations using Python.  
This profile is a mix of experiments, learning projects, and a few more polished tools.

Some projects are more finished than others – many were parked when new ideas came up.  
Feel free to use any code for inspiration.
