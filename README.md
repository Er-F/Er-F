Some projects have a more finished look than others, usually because they were abandoned for new and interesting topics. Feel free to use the code for inspiration!

## Project Topics 
- **Machine Learning:** Model comparison, building from scratch, hyperparameter tuning, explainability, and regression analysis.  
- **Dashboards & Visualization:** Interactive Streamlit dashboards, Pandas visualizations, map plotting, and heatmap generation for real-time insights.  
- **Text Analysis:** Sentiment and topic modeling on job listings.  
- **Data Engineering:** Designing data warehouses with DBT and medallion architecture.  
- **Data Processing & Preparation:** Explore data cleaning techniques in [Project 03](https://github.com/Er-F/02_Project_Analysis).  
- **Regression & Statistics:** Analyzing Californian housing prices with folium maps, correlation heatmaps, and model evaluations. [here](https://github.com/Er-F/14-Statistics-And-Math/settings).
