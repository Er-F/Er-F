## Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a Data Scientist with hands-on experience in building applications and models for businesses that can provide valuable insight. One project can be found on my LinkedIn profile, related to the internship I had early in my career.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About My Experience 


- **Dashboard and Business Intelligence**: Streamlit is a powerful python library that allows you to quickly create sophisticated dashboards. I have experience using Streamlit in several of my projects to create user-friendly applications. 
  
- **GenAI**: I have done several personal projects where GenAI-APIs have been used. Have a look at one of my repos. 
  
- **Machine Learning & Model Building**: I have experience from building and testing several machine learning models in relation to classification and regression. 
  
- **Data Processing & Preparation**: Data processing is an extremely important task for any Data Scientist, and it is important to do this well before using the data in any analytical work. From my experience I have found it to be time-saving to spend slightly more time on this part of the project. A clean and trustworthy dataset is always worth it!
  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: I believe that a key part of performing good analytical work is presenting results in visualizations that easily provide insights and gives the reader a quick grasp of what type of analytical work that has been done.
  
- **Data Engineering**: I have broad experience with Data Engineering, where I have helped several companies with problem solving related to their data warehouse and have hands-on experience with the related technologies: SAS, DBT, Netezza, Databricks, Azure etc.
