## I'm Erik, welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a Python programmer with experience in building applications and models that provide insight from a buisness perspecitve.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About My Experience 
I have a strong background in:

- **Python Programming**: I took several courses at university in programming and have continously used Python in my work since then. I very much enjoy the language and try to use new libraries as I co
  
- **Machine Learning & Model Building**: Developing and implementing machine learning models is a very interesting and rewarding task. I have hands-on experience with ML from work (e.g. internship), where I built and tetsed different models (Regression and Classification) for a specific purpose.
  
- **Data Processing & Preperation**: Data processing is an exstremely important task for any Data Scientist, and it is important to do this well before using the data in any analytical work. From my experience I have found it to be time-saving to spend slightly more time on this part of the project. A clean and trustworthy dataset is always worth it!
  
- **Data Analysis & Visulization**: I believe that a key part of performing good analytical work is presenting results in visulizations that easily provide insights and gives the reader a quick grasp of what type of analytical work that has been done.
  
- **Data Engineering**: I have broad experience with Data Engineering from work, where I have worked with datawarehousing and related technologies such as SAS, DBT, Netezza etc.
