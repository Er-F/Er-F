## I'm Erik, welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a Data Scientist with hands-on experience in building applications and models for businesses that can provide valuable insight and possibly help them make better decisions. One project can be found on my LinkedIn profile, related to the internship I had at Spirit Energy.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About My Experience 

- **Python Programming**: I took several courses at university in programming and have continuously used Python in my work ever since. It is a strong tool and I very much appreciate all the open source libraries!
  
- **Dashboard and Business Intelligence**: Steamlit is a powerful python library that allows you to quickly create sophisticated dashboards. I have used it in several projects to create user-friendly applications. 
  
- **GenAI**: I have done several personal projects where GenAI-APIs have been used. Have a look at one of my repos. 
  
- **Machine Learning & Model Building**: I have experience from building and testing several machine learning models in relation to classification and regression. 
  
- **Data Processing & Preparation**: Data processing is an extremely important task for any Data Scientist, and it is important to do this well before using the data in any analytical work. From my experience I have found it to be time-saving to spend slightly more time on this part of the project. A clean and trustworthy dataset is always worth it!
  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: I believe that a key part of performing good analytical work is presenting results in visualizations that easily provide insights and gives the reader a quick grasp of what type of analytical work that has been done.
  
- **Data Engineering**: I have broad experience with Data Engineering, where I have helped several companies with problem solving related to their data warehouse and have hands-on experience with the related technologies: SAS, DBT, Netezza, Databricks, Azure etc.
