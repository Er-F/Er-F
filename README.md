## Comment on coding experience 
  
**Dashboards, Visulizations & Business Intelligence**: Visulizing results is a very important skillset for any Data Scientist, otherwise any strong result can prove to be meaningless if the audience/client misses the main finding. Here are some of the good techniques I have experience with: 
- **Streamlit (Python)**: Built dashboards for interacting with GenAI models 
- **Power BI**: Built several dashboards and datamodels to present buisness analytics 
- **Python Visulizations**: Created sophisticated visulizations using the known libraries Plotly, Seaborn and MatplotLib 

**GenAI & Text Manipulation**: GenAI is gaining significant traction in all companies, therefore it is important that all data scientists (including me) get hands-on experience with this field and all tools that are related. Here are some of the topics I have worked on to increase my experience in the field: 
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Used LLAMA models to perform sentiment analysis to investigate correlation between positive/negative sentiment on other variables (e.g. on LinkedIN job descriptions)
- **Topic Modeling**: Using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Iâ€™ve (among other things) investigated the main topics of LinkedIn job listings
- **SQL-Agents**: Created an SQL-agent based on OpenAI API that interacted with an SQL database, and solved several difficult problems based on simple prompts from user input 
  
**Machine Learning**: I have experience from building and testing several machine learning models for real world applications. Here is a summary of what I have done: 
- **Model Building**: Built and testing several different types of ML models for real-world applications.
- **Explainability**: Investigated feature importance from trained models to ensure transparent results.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned model parameters to find optimal solution to specific problems.
- **Programmed model from Scratch**: As a master student I built a model from scratch as part of a ML-course. Take a look at the related repository!
  
**Data Processing & Preparation**: This is an exstremely important task for Data Scientists, as the first priority is always to ensure to have the best possible data quality before starting to use it in models or analytical tasks. Personally I use the python libraries Pandas, Missingno and SciPy (to calculate statistical values, e.g. to remove outliers) to effectivly clean data before performing Exploratory Data Analysis (ETA). 
- Take a look at the cleaning done in the repo: [Project 03](https://github.com/Er-F/02_Project_Analysis)

**Data Engineering**: I have broad experience with Data Engineering, and I have assisted several companies on improving their data warehouse. This is some of the technology I have used: DBT & SQL, Databricks, Azure. SAS DI/EG. Specific DBT examples will be uploaded in the future!
